OpenFlow 1.2 Software Switch
----------------------------

This is an OpenFlow 1.2 [1] compatible user-space software switch
implementation. The code is based on the Ericsson TrafficLab 1.1 softswitch
implementation [2], with changes in the forwarding plane to support
OpenFlow 1.2.

The following components are available in the release:
  - ofdatapath: the switch implementation
  - ofprotocol: secure channel for connecting the switch to the controller
  - oflib:      a library for converting to/from 1.2 wire format
  - dpctl:      a tool for configuring the switch from the console

Getting Started
---------------

Dependencies
============

The code was tested on Ubuntu 11.10. In order to compile the switch your system
must have the following libraries.

$ sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev libxerces-c2-dev libpcre3-dev flex bison

Pre-Building
============

Add the shared libraries present in netbee-dev to your /usr/local/lib directory.
You should have root permission to do this:
    $ sudo cp netbee-dev/libn*.so /usr/local/lib

Run ldconfig:
    $ sudo ldconfig

Put the folder netbee-dev/nbee in the /usr/include:
    $ sudo cp -R netbee-dev/nbee /usr/include


Building
========

To build, run the following commands in the of12softswitch directory:
    $ ./boot.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make

Running
=======

Start the datapath:
    $ sudo udatapath/ofdatapath --datapath-id=<dpid> --interfaces=<if-list> ptcp:<port>

This will start the datapath, with the given datapath id, and interace list,
opening a passive tcp connection on the given port. For a complete list of
options, use the --help argument.

Start the secure channel:
    $ secchan/ofprotocol tcp:<switch-host>:<switch-port> tcp:<ctrl-host>:<ctrl-port>

This will open TCP connections to both the switch and the controller, relaying
OpenFlow protocol messages between the two. For a complete list of options,
use the --help argument.

You can send requests to the switch using the dpctl utility:
    $ cd utilities
    $ ./dpctl tcp:<switch-host>:<switch-port> stats-flow table=0

For a complete list of commands and arguments, use the --help argument.
