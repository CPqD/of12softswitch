	This set of functions is used to load the NetPDL description contained in an
	XML file, parse it, and create the corresponding description in memory.

	The exported functions are very simple:
	- nbProtoDBXMLLoad(): Load an XML file containing the NetPDL database and
	create an internal representation of the file itself
	- nbProtoDBXMLCleanup(): clean all the internal structures allocated at the 
	previous step.

	The biggest advantage of this library is that it creates a more user-friendly 
	representation of the NetPDL database, structured as a set of 'C' structures.
	All the database is organized under the form of the struct _nbNetPDLDatabase.

	For details about accessing data contained in the NetPDL database, please
	refer to the documentation of the struct _nbNetPDLDatabase.
*/

// Planned:
//- nbProtoDBXMLSave(): save the internal representation to a binary file,
//	which provides a more compact way to store the NetPDL database. This binary file 
//	is still portable across different platforms.
