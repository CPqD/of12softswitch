	\brief This module allows filtering and extracting selected fields from network packets.

	This module provides a set classes, methods and properties that allows processing packets using
	the NetPDL technology (that defines protocol headers), the NetPFL language (that defines what to do
	on network packets in terms of filtering and field extraction), and the NetVM engine (that does the
	actual job).

	\brief This class allows filtering and extracting selected fields from network packets.
	
	This class hides all the details of the NetPFL compiler, exporting a clean and easy interface.
	In case this is needed, the actual NetPDL compiler can be accessed by looking at the documentation
	of the <a href="../nbpflcompiler/index.htm" target="_top">NetPFL Compiler module</a>.

	Some additional classes (and structures) are required in order to parse the data returned by the NetVM
	engine. For instance, a call to the GetExtractedFieldsReader() method returns a nbExtractedFieldsReader
	object that will be used to parse the extracted fields and print their values and such.

	In case this class is used to simply filter packets, the GetExtractedFieldsReader() will return
	and nbExtractedFieldsReader object with an empty _nbExtractedFieldsDescriptorVector object.

	The nbPacketEngine class allows also to configure the debug compiler options using the SetXXX methods.
	This is usually required only in case of debugging.
	
	To get compiling information and structures:
	- The messages created by the compilation are available with the GetCompMessageList  that returns a pointer to a _nbNetPFLCompilerMessages structures. 
	- To get the last error message call the GetLastError method.
	- The NETIL compiled code  is available with the GetCompiledCode method.
	- The _nvmRuntimeEnvironment is available with the GetNetVMRuntimeEnvironment method.
	
	The nbPacketEngine class must be allocated using the nbAllocatePacketEngine() function because is an abstract class.
	The de-allocation is done through the nbDeallocatePacketEngine() function.
