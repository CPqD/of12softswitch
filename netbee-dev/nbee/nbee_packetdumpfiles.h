	\brief This class defines an object that is able to manage capture files saved in the WinPcap/libpcap format.

	This class defines a set of methods that aim at managing the binary dump of a network packet.
	It allows to create, read, write, scan the file. It provides an easy way to get access to WinPcap/libpcap
	files. In addition, it provides also indexing, i.e. it allows accessing to a random packet in the dump, while
	WinPcap/libpcap allows only progressive scan.

	Please note that this is an abstract class; please use the nbAllocatePacketDumpFilePcap() method in order to create
	an instance of this class. For cleanup, the programmer must use the nbDeallocatePacketDumpFilePcap() function.
