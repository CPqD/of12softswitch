	\brief Structure that contains the common members of all XML elements.

	This structure contains the members that are common to all the more specialized structures
	associated to any XML element.

	This structure is useful to access to any XML element without knowing, a priori, which is the
	correct element. Most of the functions of this module return a generic struct _nbNetPDLElementBase;
	then, you can determine the correct element type by checking the value of the 'Type' member
	of this structure, and then casting this pointer to the correct type.

	Example:
	<pre>
	struct _nbNetPDLElementBase *GenericPtr;
	struct _nbNetPDLElementProto *ProtocolPtr;
	GenericPtr= FunctionReturningNetPDLElement();
	if (GenericPtr->Type == nbNETPDL_EL_PROTO)
	ProtocolPtr= (struct _nbNetPDLElementProto *) GenericPtr;
	</pre>

	However, please take care that members of this structure are not pointers, but indexes
	(in the _nbNetPDLDatabase::GlobalElementsList array) of the corresponding element.
	Therefore, for accessing to a given element the nbNETPDL_GET_ELEMENT() macro is provided,
	such as:

	<pre>
	struct _nbNetPDLDatabase *NetPDLDatabase;
	struct _nbNetPDLElementBase *NetPDLElement, *ParentNetPDLElement;

	NetPDLDatabase= nbProtoDBXMLLoad(NetPDLFile, ErrBuf, sizeof(ErrBuf);

	ParentNetPDLElement= nbNETPDL_GET_ELEMENT(NetPDLDatabase, NetPDLElement->Parent);

		element which does not exist (e.g. they do not have any child, or such).
		Therefore, the number of elements in this array is one more than the number of XML elements contained in
		the NetPDL file, and the first element is NULL.

		All the XML elements encountered in the XML file are associated to a struct _nbNetPDLElementBase, or 
		a structure derived from it. This allow scanning the XML file through these structures instead
		of using libraries (and structures) that manage XML files.

		However, the most important elements of the NetPDL file (e.g. protocols) are further
		organized in a more appropriate way (e.g. struct _nbNetPDLElementProto). This further
		easies the interaction with the NetPDL database.

	\brief Common structure associated to each protocol field.

	This structure contains the common members associated to each NetPDL field. This structure
	aims at providing a general way to get access to field-related structures. For instance,
	the proper structure can be inferred by checking the value of the 'FieldType' member
	and using the proper cast.

	Therefore, if you want to get access to the real structure, you need to cast
	the pointer to _nbNetPDLElementFieldBase into the real structure, which will be
	determined by the value of the 'FieldType' member.	

	The usage of this structure is funcionally equivalent to the struct _nbNetPDLElementBase,
	although it is limited to NetPDL fields. The the list of such these elements is defined
	in #nbNetPDLFieldNodeTypes_t.
