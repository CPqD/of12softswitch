	This group includes all the classes related to the packet decoding engine included in the NetBee library.
	The main class is the nbPacketDecoder, which implements the packet decoder itself. In addition, you can use
	the nbPacketDecoderVars and nbPacketDecoderLookupTables classes, which allow to manage variables and lookup
	tables used by the packet decoder itself. For instance, these classes allow to add or modify the content of
	a variable or a lookup table, and are shared between "user space" and the nbPacketDecoder class (hence, any
	modification will influence the behaviour of the packet decoder).

	Please note that the nbPacketDecoderLookupTables can be used also alone, without any active instance of the 
	nbPacketDecoder class, although this feature has not been widely tested.

	which tells the Packet Decoder that it has to generate both PDML (complete) and PSML documents;
	however, only the fragment related to the last decoded packet is kept in memory.

	If the user wants to keep the data related to all the packets, it has to add the 
	nbDECODER_KEEPALLPDML and nbDECODER_KEEPALLPSML flags. In this case, the user will be able to
	dump on disk the PSML and PDML files related to the packets being decoded through the
	appropriate use of the nbPSMLReader and nbPDMLReader classes.

	In case nbDECODER_GENERATEPDML_COMPLETE is not set, the PDML document is created with the basic tags.
	In case nbDECODER_GENERATEPSML is not set, the PSML document is not created at all.

	If the user does not want any of these flags, it has to call the nbAllocatePacketDecoder() with a parameter
	equal to 'zero'.

	\brief This class defines an object that is able to decode network packets according to the NetPDL description.

	This class defines a set of methods that aim at analyzing the binary dump of a network packet
	and return a decoded packet, according to the PDML and PSML descriptions. The decoding will be done
	through the use of a protocol description according to the NetPDL language.

	Proper classes (e.g. nbPSMLReader and nbPDMLReader) can be used to return the decoded packet to the caller
	in order to make some further elaboration. For instance, these classes can be used to get access to every packet
	field, and so on.

	The main method of this class is DecodePacket(), which is used to submit a packet to this class.

	Please note that this is an abstract class; please use the nbAllocatePacketDecoder() method in order to create
	an instance of this class. For cleanup, the programmer must use the nbDeallocatePacketDecoder() function.

	\warning You may have to set some global variable before decoding anything. In this case, you have to get a 
	pointer to the class that manages internal variables (i.e. GetPacketDecoderVars() ) and call the appropriate methods in there.
	This can be required if you want to customize some part of the decoding (e.g. if you want to display literal 
	names such as 'host.foo.bar' instead of IP addresses).
